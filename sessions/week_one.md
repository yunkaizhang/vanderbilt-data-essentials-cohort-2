Understanding the Question + Getting Data  
- Critical thinking and active questioning  
- Acquiring domain expertise  
- Articulating the question  
- Review of code for today (pandas API)  

Coding tasks:  
1. get and begin cleaning data  
    * `import pandas as pd`  
    *  Create a DataFrame, `ha_costs_df`, from the `mmd_heart_attack_data.csv` file.   
        - Examine the first 5 rows and the last five rows of the TN heart attack  data.  
        - Check the data types of each column by using `.info`.  
        - Keep only the rows where facilities are in TN.    
        - Print the dimensions of the data. How many TN counties are represented in the heart attack costs data?
        - How many counties are classified as Urban? How many as Rural?
        - Examine the distribution of costs (contained in the `analysis_value` column).
        - Does there appear to be a difference in costs between Urban counties and Rural counties?
    * Create a DataFrame, `cancer_costs_df`, from the `mmd_cancer_data.csv` file.  
        - Look at the head and tail of the DataFrame.  
        - Print the shape of the `cancer_costs_df`.  
        - Keep only the rows where facilities are in TN.  
        - Print the dimensions of the data. How many TN counties are represented in the cancer costs data?
        - You should have found that the datasets have a different number of counties. Which counties are missing from one of the datasets?
        - Examine the distribution of costs.
    * Create a DataFrame, `income_df`, from the IRS CSV file.
        - Keep only the data that pertains to Tennessee.  
        - Look at the head and the tail  
        - Print the shape  
        - Keep only the following columns:  `['STATE', 'COUNTYNAME', 'agi_stub', 'N1', 'mars1', 'MARS2', 'MARS4', 'N2', 'NUMDEP', 'ELDERLY', 'A00100', 'N02650', 'A02650', 'N02300', 'A02300']`  
        - rename those columns: `['state', 'county', 'income_bucket', 'return_count', 'single_returns', 'joint_returns', 'head_of_house_returns', 'exemptions', 'dependents', 'elderly', 'agi', 'returns_with_total_inc','total_inc_amt', 'returns_with_unemployment', 'unemployment_comp']`
